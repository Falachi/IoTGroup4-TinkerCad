# IoTGroup4-TinkerCad
An upload of the tinkercad design with arduino codes, schematic view and circuit view for my Internet of Things module.
Interactive Tinkercad can be view here: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/htQXLA3Q1D4

It's a mess with a lot of if statements, but a great opportunity for me. I hope to try more arduinos in the future!
